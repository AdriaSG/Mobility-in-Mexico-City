# Mobility Analysis Tool (Mexico-City)
### General 
This application is the demo por a geospatial analysis tool applied to data from Mexico City. The website allows user to interact with 3 main maps: 1) Public transport: user can see subway, bus and bicycle stations as well as bicycle lanes, 2) Traffic during de day: showing aggregated data from Uber Q1 2020 to visualize traffic density in the city along the day and 3) Mobility Paths: where user visulizes most traveled paths across clutered districs in the city. All maps are interactive but with static data. 

###Prerequisites

###Handling 

## 1 UML
## 2 DDD 
For the [Domain Driven Design diagram](https://github.com/AdriaSG/Mobility-in-Mexico-City/blob/main/tasks/DDD%20-%20Urban%20Mobility%20app.png), I had sketched what would be the complete problem space for the application as starting point while drafting the general goal of the application. There could be found several different subdomains, components and features that either had been implemented or would be implemented in the future to deliver promised value to the end-user. The DDD diagramp is also mapping the up and downstream relations as well as key partnetships for the application to work properly. Furthermore I had created an small glossary containing ubiquitous language for each domain, this would allow a better understanding of the architecture and code.

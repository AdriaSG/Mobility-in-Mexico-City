## 2 DDD 
For the Domain Driven Design, I had sketched what would be the complete problem space for the application as starting point while drafting the general goal of the application. There could be found several different subdomains, components and features that either had been implemented or would be implemented in the future to deliver promised value to the end-user. The DDD diagramp is also mapping the up and downstream relations as well as key partnetships for the application to work properly. Furthermore I had created an small glossary containing ubiquitous language for each domain, this would allow a better understanding of the architecture and code.

## Ubiquitous language Glossary 

For better Domain Driven Design understanding some specific language within the domain of urban mobility are explained in following glossary. 

- **Demo Maps.** Collection of interactive but data static maps. This is a general demostration of maps that could be created using this tool, maps are fixed hmtl that allows user to zoom in and out, draw polygons and show legends. Maps cannot be copied or modified. 
- **Layer.** This term is used to determine each graph type (i.e polygon, point, heatmap, etc), multiple layers could be used within the same map for more advanced visualizations.
- **Filter.** Filters are applicable at map level for all layers included in it. It filters data based on selected data attribute. 
- **Slider.** When user adds a filter, an slider could also be added for end user to be able to interact with such filter by different rages of data. Slider enherit filter properties so it's managed also at map level. 
- **Maps services.** Third party services that application relies on to function, example: Open Street Map, Mapbox, Kepler.gl
- **Smart reccomendations.** This is a completely external module that uses Machine Learning to deliver suggestions to improve mobility in determined polygons as per the data analysed, this module could be implemented with Edlich's investments.
